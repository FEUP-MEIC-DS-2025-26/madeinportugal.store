	- `components/` — Reusable UI components
	- `pages/` — Route-level pages
	- `hooks/` — Reusable React hooks
	- `services/` — API client wrappers to call backend microservices
	- `types/` — TypeScript typings and domain models
	- `utils/` — Utility functions
	- `assets/` — Images and fonts
	- `styles/` — Global styles and themes
- `public/` — Static public assets
- `tests/` — Test files and helpers
- `scripts/` — Dev / build helper scripts

See `src/README.md` for more details and conventions.
